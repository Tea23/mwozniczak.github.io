        - 'Co-developed web frontend for Dyamon, flagship Atos monitoring tool and a part of ATF (Atos Technology Framework). Reworked and refactored the vast majority of code to improve code readability, as well as to enhance the functionality and configurability. The end result is now supported by a robust, extendable authentication framework and routing system, configurability via YAML, and clearly defined OOP class system.'
        - 'Developed a bridge between Dyamon->MDR (Master Data Record), as well as a configurable system for exporting to other CMDB systems such as Atrium or HPAM. The export system itself is extensible with custom processing functions, of which many exist to support the creation of CIs, relations, and Product Software categories, among others.'

              I would like to thank Michal for the great support. In work they are very independent taking very different roles: Architect, Designer, Analytic, Tester.

              They almost not need me at all ;) And that’s the most valuable – because I am trying to do it as a best effort addition to may daily tasks.

              I am really grateful – it is a pleasure to work together.

              Just a quick email to say thanks for the scripting work so far. The standard of work has been excellent and you have always delivered on time.
            
              The script you have developed will make a big difference to the UK Shared Services Improvement Programme.
            
              Look forward to working with you on other projects soon!

              I just want to say thanks very much for the assistance with the HIS Auditing script and for turning it around so quickly.

              It might need a tweak in the future as we may want to add more features to it, but it works brilliantly for what we need right now. Saved us a lot of time :)

              Efekt końcowy bardzo spodobał się także mojej szefowej, która jest zachwycona tym co udało się osiągnąć.

              Ponadto Michał w czasie okresu współpracy podpowiadał mi również różnego rodzaju rozwiązania, które z perspektywy laika wydawały się niemożliwe

              Jeszcze raz DZIĘKUJĘ

              Thank you very much for the scripts, they helped us a lot and we saved a few good weeks of man hours, moreover they can be re-used for future audits :)
              
              Without your scripts it would not be possible to generate audits with 100% perfection, thank you for excellent work.

              Understanding the requirement was challenging and you are spot-on providing the right scripts. ay be you don't know how they reduced our workload, a few of my colleagues who borrowed them are already delighted by the work.

              You deserve a big thanks as the scripts helped us to reach our deadlines. Looking forward to work with you.

    soundbite: Exceeded my expectations in terms of both quality and delivery.
    content: >
              Michal has been providing scripts for the UK Network Shared Services Improvement Program. The scripts generated have helped us immensely in helping to reduce the amount of manual audit and mapping from one configuration to another. 

              These have been completed quickly and professionally and have exceeded my expectation in terms of both quality and delivery.

              Michal is very helpful and works well with the guys in the UK to develop a good understanding of what's required up front, then quick to turn around the initial scripts and amendments. This has enabled us to reduce the time and effort it's taking us to deliver certain elements of the project.
